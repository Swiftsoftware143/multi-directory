//! Request-body read deadline (kanban t_52b9f3c7).

//! Multi-Directory reads a request body on every route a stranger can reach: the public auth
//! routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`), the
//! two payment webhook receivers (`/webhooks/stripe`, `/webhooks/paypal`), the public write
//! routes (`/submissions`, `/b2b/register`, `/city-requests`, `/bookmarks/toggle`,
//! `/businesses/:id/claim`, `/businesses/:id/images`), the visitor/beacon routes
//! (`/visitors/track`, `/visitors/page-view`, `/visitors/event`, `/visitor/register`,
//! `/visitor/login`), the data-pipeline ingest (`/pipeline/ingest`), guest messaging
//! (`/messages/:business_id`) — and, on the protected surface behind `auth_guard`, every one of
//! the ~300 POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE API routes. Before this module a client could send a request
//! head with a valid `Content-Length` and then stop: the task, the connection and the
//! partially-read body buffer stayed pinned for ever. No 408, no close, no log line. Measured live
//! on this app's deployed binary `c1f3721e` (before/run.txt): 15 of 15 stalled-body legs parked
//! with no response inside a 45 s budget, including the two payment webhooks, the public
//! submit-a-business route and a protected `POST /api/v1/directories` carrying a real session.
//! WorkflowSwift closed the same hole in t_e7cba83e (408 at t+30.0 s), ADASwift in t_b3d626ed,
//! FunnelSwift in t_488a19d4 and CoreSwift-CRM in t_59745689; this is the Multi-Directory arm of

/// hashes a password, the Stripe/PayPal receivers verify a signature over the raw bytes, the

/// legitimately in progress — for a claim or a signup that is a LOST CUSTOMER, not a retried
/// login. This middleware bounds only the thing that is actually unbounded: a client that sends a
/// request head and then stops. A handler that legitimately takes seconds is untouched, because
/// the deadline is over by the time it runs.
///
/// **The deadline is total, measured from the headers** — not a per-chunk idle timeout that resets
/// on every frame (`tower_http::timeout::RequestBodyTimeoutLayer` works that way). A resetting
/// timeout is not a bound here at all: a client that dribbles one byte every N-1 seconds holds the
/// task, the connection and the buffer for ever. On elapse the inner future is dropped, so the
/// partially-read body goes with it, the request is answered `408`, and the event is logged.
///
/// **What a legitimately slow sender gets.** A body that *is* arriving is read at full speed; the
/// deadline only fires on one that has stopped. If a body really does exceed the deadline the
/// request is answered `408` and closed, and the sender (a browser form, Stripe, or one of our own
/// producers) retries — at that point the sender had stopped mid-body, so the event was already
/// undeliverable.
///
/// On success the bytes read here are handed to the inner service as an already-complete body, so
/// the handler's own extractor (`Json`, `Bytes`, `Multipart`) sees exactly the bytes the client
/// sent — same bytes, same headers, same limit, because the read below *is* the same extractor: a
